### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide valuable insights by analyzing the functioning of technical support to improve better Performamce & Customer Satisfaction.  

#### Data Sources
Technical Support data: The primary dataset is in CSV file "Onyx Data -DataDNA Dataset Challenge - Technical Support Dataset - May 2024.xlsx" containing Technical Support Details of the Organisation.

### Objective
This Analysis aims to analyze the functioning of technical support through KPIs like Ticket Trends, SLA adherence patterns & CSAT score, etc.
This Interactive Dashboard answers the All the following Challenge Questions:
1. What are the peak ticket creation times?
2. How does the first response and resolution times compare against SLAs?
3. Explore customer satisfaction rates across agents, topics and other categories.

1. Resolution and SLA Adherence:
Out of 2330 total tickets, 1355 were resolved within the SLA for both first response and resolution times.400 tickets are still in progress, highlighting a need for improved resolution processes.

2.Ticket Volume Trends:
The peak ticket creation hour is at the 15th hour, with the majority of tickets (1566) being raised during after-hours, compared to 764 during work hours.

3.Topic and Product Analysis:
Under the Product Setup topic, 374 out of 630 tickets were resolved within SLA, but significant SLA violations were noted: 311 for first response and 783 for resolution.The Ready to Use Software category saw the highest number of tickets (1010), with 610 resolved within SLA.

Heather Urry had the fewest SLA violations for resolution (42 tickets).

### Recommendations
#### 1. Implement an improved after-hours support strategy.
Since the maximum number of tickets (1566) were raised during after-hours, consider increasing staffing or offering automated support solutions during these times to handle the high volume effectively.
#### 2. Optimize First Response Time (FRT):
Conduct training sessions focused on improving first response times. Introduce performance incentives for agents who consistently meet or exceed FRT SLAs. 
#### 3. Enhance Resolution Time:
Identify bottlenecks in the resolution process and implement process improvements. This could include better documentation, enhanced troubleshooting tools, and more efficient escalation procedures.
#### 4. Focus on High-Volume Topics and Categories:
Develop detailed knowledge base articles and self-service resources for these high-volume areas. Provide specialized training for support agents on these topics to enhance their expertise and efficiency.
#### 5. Monitor and Enhance CSAT Scores:
Regularly review customer feedback to identify areas for improvement. Implement follow-up procedures for negative feedback to resolve customer issues and improve satisfaction. Recognize and reward agents with high CSAT scores to encourage positive performance.
#### 6. Enhance Email Support Efficiency:
Streamline the email ticketing process with templates and automated responses for common queries. Ensure there is adequate after-hours email support to handle the volume effectively.
#### 7. Encourage Customer Feedback and Survey Participation:
The dataset includes many empty survey values, indicating that a significant number of customers did not participate in the survey. Actively encourage customers to provide their valuable feedback and participate in surveys regarding the agent service.

### Challenges faced
The dataset contains numerous empty survey responses, indicating a significant number of customers did not participate in the survey. This lack of participation poses a challenge in accurately analyzing agent performance, as the incomplete data may not fully reflect customer satisfaction levels and feedback.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, this technical support analysis project has provided valuable insights into key performance metrics and trends within the support team. By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, we have identified areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, which can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the technical support operations.By implementing these recommendations, the technical support team can enhance their performance, resulting in a potential increase in CSAT scores and overall customer satisfaction. This project has laid a solid foundation for ongoing analysis and improvement in technical support operations.
